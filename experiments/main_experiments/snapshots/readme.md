# Model Snapshots

For our evaluation we use two types of snapshots:

- synthetic snapshots where the differences in weights are randomly generated (for details see [here](synthetic))
- trained snapshots where the models were fine-tuned to have a realistic adjustment of the parameters (for details
  see [here](trained))
