# Datasets
- This directory contains information on how to download, access, and prepare the datasets used in our experiments.
- In general, we use PyTorch's ImageFolder dataset for image datasets and a custom extension of PyTorch's TensorDataset
  through our experiments.
- For every dataset we provide in a separate readme the download link we used and if necessary a transformation script
  to make the datasets compatible with the data loaders described above.
- For every dataset we also have a copy of the transformed dataset in our Nextcloud. In case you need access to the
  datasets as we used them, feel free to reach out.
